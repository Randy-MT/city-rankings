# wa-state-city-rankings
### Goal of Project
***
To create a customizable location search whereby combined data can be used to expose potential cities of interest based on individual needs.
### Usage
***
Interactive widgets are incorporated within the notebook.  Customizing the widgets adds or removes weighting within individual metrics to provide a customized search based on the personal importance of each metric.

### Known Limitations
***
Only one state was chosen (Washington State).  Standardizing data sources across the United States is needed for further usage and automation.  Null values exist within some county data sets.  

### Future Considerations 
***
Automated and consistent data sources need to be harnessed to allow for expansion past an individual state.

### Data Sources
***
Data sources are linked within the notebook file.  A local copy of each data source is required to obtain results from within the notebook. </br>
