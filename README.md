### Known Limitations
***
Only one state was chosen (Washington State).  Standardizing data sources across the United States is needed for further usage.  Also, within the chosen state, Benton County was not included within the data sources.

### Data Sources
***
Data sources are linked within the notebook file.  A local copy of each data source is required to obtain results from within the notebook. </br>
